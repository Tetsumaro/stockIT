    <h2>Group Reflection</h2>

    <p>Overall, we consider it to be a very positive experience to be able to work together as a team. Each of us took responsibility for our allocated roles and tried our best to make a positive contribution. Fortunately, we did not encounter any impassable issues in terms of collaboration and teamwork. When a team member requested feedback, many of us actively participated in the discussion and provided constructive opinions. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Please find an example of our active forum of achieving a better outcome shown below.</p>

    <p>We have conducted similar brainstorm sessions (as to the example above) via Teams chats almost daily while maintaining formal online meetings twice a week. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p>Overall, We feel that our engagement in our bi-weekly meetings have made some level of improvement over time. Although we struggled to keep it structured initially, we quickly learnt to hold it more efficiently by strictly following a pre-agreed agenda.  Another positive aspect of our team collaboration is the cross-sharing of our knowledge base. Through exchanging our first assignment and its feedback, we came to the conclusion that some members might have skillsets that were better suited to different content areas for assignment 2. In our team, experienced members were encouraged to share their expertise with others, creating a positive learning environment for the group. Examples were when Taylen assisted others in setting up the groupâ€™s GitHub with his self-made Youtube and when Brandon proofread the work prepared by a non-native English member.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We used the chats function in Teams for daily communications among members. While our daily chats were a great way for everybody to stay in touch and provide daily updates on the progress of their assigned section, we feel that this may not have been the best way to maintain our conversation records. Although we tried to keep a separate chat log for each topic, our chat history has cluttered over time, and become hard to review the past conversations. One solution may be to use the channel function or SharePoint instead of the chats function. We plan to have a planning session to brainstorm this further prior commencing assignment 3. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We have learned the hard-working nature of our group. The commitment and dedication of each member toward this assignment has been remarkable. It demonstrates our determination to succeed as mature-age students. Most of our members worked full time during the day while dedicating nights and weekends to study. We refused to waste our time and strived to take advantage of this learning opportunity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To some extent, it was surprising to find that we functioned very well as a team. According to our personality tests, we were a relatively introverted group of individuals. We had concerns that this fact would negatively affect the way we could collaborate as a group. We are proud of overcoming our initial concerns and believe we have formed a well-organized team with a positive and supportive culture. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Each member surprised us for their uniqueness and intelligence. Ahmet is generally a quiet person but makes simple yet effective comments when he speaks up. Brandon has excellent interview skills, which surprised not only the team but also himself. Hugo has amazing people skill at such a young age. Taylen always surprises us with how skillful he is with IT.  Tim is a well-balanced businessperson who is logical, thoughtful, and assertive. Tetsu is a hard-working individual who still enjoys studying in his mid-40s. What surprised us was that we all had unique strengths that positively impacted the team.</p>
