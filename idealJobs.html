    <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <br>
    <p> We have found both similarities and differences for our ideal jobs. The summary of the findings is tabled and outlined below.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Three of our team members consider roles in the public sector for their ideal jobs. Of those who chose a private sector, two (Brandon and Tetsu) picked the full stack developer role whilst the remaining member (Taylen) is determined to become a firmware engineer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We found that each job required both technical and soft skills. However, the emphasis on soft skills tends to be stronger for those in the public sector. We believe that there are two reasons for this. The first is because roles within the private sector are highly specialised, so the job advertisements aim to attract only those who have specific technical expertise. The second is because the public sector is likely to have a more hierarchical organisational structure and is vital for employees to understand and follow a chain of command which requires them to have good people skills.</p>

    <h3>Similarities</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Among our ideal jobs, the most common technical requirement is programming skills. All three roles in the private sector require fluency in at least one or two programming languages. The knowledge in SQL databases and version control systems such as GIT is also highly regarded in the private sector.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Among the many soft skills, communication is by far the most preferable skill in the public sector. The ability to manage people is another important skill that is sought after in this sector. The skill includes the management of stakeholders, tasks, and projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Roles in the private sector tend to emphasise an ability to adapt and learn new technologies rather than people skills. This may indicate the employers’ intention to hire a highly specialised technician.</p>
    <br>




Differences
We found that each role has its unique aspect. For example, Taylen’s role as a firmware engineer requires him to understand basic electronics and mechatronics which are not a requirement for the other roles mentioned. Brandon and Tetsu chose the same job title as full stack developer. However, there is a prominent difference in required skill sets. Brandon’s role has a stronger emphasis on programming skills. On the other hand, Tetsu’s role leans toward a thorough understanding of the web application development process rather than focus on programming.
Also, every job has an element of unique specialisation. For example, in the case of Ahmet, it is the teaching. For Hugo, it is the cyber security. For Tim, it is the data management/analysis.

Conclusion
We found that there are some skills and knowledge that commonly attract our potential employers. These are technical expertise in programming, SQL database, and version control system as well as soft skills such as communication and management skills.
We also found that there were differences in each job. These differences arise as the result of different specialisation that we choose to pursue.
It is concluded that although it is important to develop commonly preferred skills specified by employers, having a specific specialisation would significantly influence our future job prospects and career path.   </p>
